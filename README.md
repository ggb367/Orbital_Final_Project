# Orbital_Final_Project
The Final Project for ASE 366K: Applied Orbital

# Info
This is the final project for UT's ASE 366K class. It contains a full fat orbit propagator with algorithms implemented from Vallado version 4.
# Use
To run, set your inital conditions in the conds class of the Main file. You will need to know either the inital orbital elements [Semimajor Axis length, eccentrcity, inclination, Right Acension of the Acsending Node, Argument of Periapsis, True Anamoly] or the inital radius and velocity vectors in the J2000 Frame.
